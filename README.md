## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently enrolled in the cs50 program as I doing a career pivot, I've completed a diploma in Information Communication Technology where I specialized in Networks. I am now trying to break into the SWE space with the knowledge I have and I plan on adding to that within this community. Currently following the roadmad.sh roadmap for backend development as thats the path I am looking to take, I do have prior programming experience as I've coded in Java before but I since picked up Pyhton and C in the cs50 program. I am looking to collaborate on all beginner to intermediate projects to further bolster my portfolio and continue my learn. I've linked all my account(s) on where you can reach me should you want to contact in any capactiy:
